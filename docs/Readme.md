##About the docs

The docs are a place for listing standards for rain.
If you're looking for guides for `how-to`s and purely examples,
you'll want to look to the [github wiki](https://github.com/Tek256/Bear-Quest/wiki).
The docs directory is maintained for file type standards given it be 
level json files, editor key bindings, or engine command interfacing.
